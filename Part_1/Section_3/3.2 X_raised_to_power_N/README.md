Implement Pow(x,n) | X raised to the power N
Problem Statement: Given a double x and integer n, calculate x raised to power n. Basically Implement pow(x, n).

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10

Output: 1024.00000

Explanation: You need to calculate 2.00000 raised to 10 which gives ans 1024.00000

Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3

Output: 9.26100

Explanation: You need to calculate 2.10000 raised to 3 which gives ans 9.26100


Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
 

Constraints:

-100.0 < x < 100.0
-231 <= n <= 231-1
-104 <= xn <= 104
