Search in a sorted 2D matrix
Problem Statement: Given an m*n 2D matrix and an integer, write a program to find if the given integer exists in the matrix.

Given matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row
Example 1:

Input: matrix = 
[[1,3,5,7],
 [10,11,16,20],
 [23,30,34,60]], 

target = 3

Output: true

Explanation: As the given integer(target) exists in the given 2D matrix, the function has returned true.
Example 2:

Input: matrix = 
[[1,3,5,7],
 [10,11,16,20],
 [23,30,34,60]], 

target = 13

Output: false

Explanation: As the given integer(target) does not exist in the given 2D matrix, the function has returned false.


Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
